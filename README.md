# Spatial luminescence
Code for processing the data generated from spatial bioluminescence assays

The code for data analysis is split into two sections:

* Organizing the raw data output from the plate reader used to collect the data into a form we are able to make sense of
* Processing and plotting the luminescence data

The processing consists of calaculating a moving average of the data and plotting a 3-D surface plot to visualize the luminescence signal distribution.
